# Changes Made to Fix Dashboard Button Functionality

## Issue Description
The dashboard buttons (other than navigation buttons) were not clickable because they lacked onClick event handlers. While the buttons had proper styling including `cursor: pointer`, they didn't have any functionality attached to them.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Created Modal Components
- Created a reusable `Modal` component (`src/components/modals/Modal.tsx`) that provides a consistent modal dialog interface
- Implemented click-outside detection and keyboard escape key handling for better user experience
- Added proper styling and animations for modal dialogs

### 2. Created Form Components
- Created `TriggerForm` component (`src/components/modals/TriggerForm.tsx`) for adding new trigger words
- Created `TemplateForm` component (`src/components/modals/TemplateForm.tsx`) for creating message templates
- Created `ConnectInstagramForm` component (`src/components/modals/ConnectInstagramForm.tsx`) for connecting Instagram accounts
- Each form includes proper validation and submission handling

### 3. Updated Dashboard Page
- Added state variables to control modal visibility
- Added onClick handlers to all previously non-functional buttons:
  - "Sign Out" button in the header
  - "Connect Instagram" button in the sidebar
  - "Add New Trigger" button in the triggers tab
  - "Create New Template" button in the templates tab
  - "Connect Instagram Account" button in the settings tab
- Implemented basic functionality for each button (showing appropriate modals)
- Added state management for storing and displaying user-created items (triggers, templates, connected accounts)

## Implementation Details
- Used React's useState hooks for state management
- Implemented a clean component architecture with proper prop passing
- Maintained the existing styling approach while adding interactive functionality
- Added appropriate form validation and user feedback

## Future Improvements
- Connect to backend API endpoints for persistent data storage
- Add edit and delete functionality for triggers and templates
- Implement proper authentication flow for the sign-out functionality
- Add loading states and error handling for API interactions
